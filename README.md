# Develpopment Repository for OmmatiDiag

This repo tracks code (mostly Python) written while working on OmmatiDiag, the
affordable, reliable and standard-compliant detector for the
[GlobalDiagnostiX][GDX]-system.

[GDX]: http://globaldiagnostix.org

The files follow the [PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code][pep8] and the
[Git branching model described by Vincent Driessen][branching] as closely as
possible.

[pep8]: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/ 
[branching]: http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/

Since this is part of a scientific project and is depending on particular
hardware, it doesn't make sense to make it closed source, the whole repository
is covered by [an (un)license](LICENSE).
[I]'m very grateful for pull requests, (better) ideas and tips!
