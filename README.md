This repo tracks some stuff I've written as part of my work as a member of the [GlobalDiagnostiX](http://globaldiagnostix.org)-alliance

I'm trying to work with an [Elphel](http://elphel.com)-camera connected to a [Raspberry Pi](http://raspberrypi.org), the code in this repo currently deals only with this.
