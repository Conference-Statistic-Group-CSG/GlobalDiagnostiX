# Development Repository for OmmatiDiag

[![Code Health](https://landscape.io/github/habi/GlobalDiagnostiX/master/landscape.svg)](https://landscape.io/github/habi/GlobalDiagnostiX/master)

This repository tracks (mostly Python) code written while working on OmmatiDiag, the affordable, reliable and standard-compliant detector for the [GlobalDiagnostiX][GDX]-system.

[GDX]: http://globaldiagnostix.org

This repository follow the [PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code][pep8] and the [Git branching model described by Vincent Driessen][branching] as closely as possible.

[pep8]: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/ 
[branching]: http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/

Since this repository is part of a scientific project and is depending on a particular set of hardware components, it seems silly to make it closed source, the whole thing is covered by [an (un)license](LICENSE).

[I, the author][I] of those files am very grateful if you notify me of any [issues](issues), submit pull requests and tell me of (better) ideas on how to implement things and any tips!
