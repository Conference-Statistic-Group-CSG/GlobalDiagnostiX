This folder of the GlobalDiagnostiX repository contains Python scripts to work with the data acquired during the Master Thesis of a student of the Bern University of Applied Sciences (MAS MedTec).

He was taking radiographies (in total more than 4000) of different combinations of Scintillators, CMOS sensors and lenses.
The scripts deal with processing, archiving and visualizing the data.
